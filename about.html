    <h3>How would you describe Amelia</h3>
    <p>
      Amelia from the meaning is industrious or hardworking woman which
      represent my kind of person. I'll be dropping fun facts about me below and
      what I love
    </p>

    <h3>What's my best pet?</h3>
    <p>
      I love dogs alot. I started liking dogs when my mom insisited we had dogs
      growing up when she found out my sister and I were scared of dogs. Like
      we'll literally not walk on the streets if there was a dog around and we'd
      always cry. So my mom thought it was best if we had a dog so we'll know
      there was nothing to fear
    </p>

    <h3>What breed of dogs do you like?</h3>
    <ul>

    <p>
      Yes I am. I'm in a relationship with the most amazing man there is and I
      love him so so very much
    </p>

    <h3>Tell us what you do and why you love what you do</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Product Designer and I find it really interesting and fasinating at
      the same time. Solving real life problems really gives me joy because my
      job makes me think and makes me think out the box.
    </p>

    <h3>What skill are you currenly learning</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currenly learning html and css. I also find it interesting as its a
      new field and I'm intrigued wondering if I can grasp it the way i learnt
      Product design
    </p>

    <h3>What do you love most about your Chisteel</h3>

    <p>
      I love how thoughtful he is. Before he makes any decision he thinks about
      it carefully and he is intentional of his decision. I love how sincere he
      is and how he pushes me to be the best version of myself
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; I love how soft he is and how much he loves me</p>
